# minecraftBlockSpeeds
Something to help me optimize an old hobby I'm revisiting.

If I continue to develop this in the future, I'll add:
 - Way to remove a single entry
 - Button to remove all entries
 - Calculating the time taken from minecraft's formula instead of this table
 - Storing the results to a file to eventually come up with the overall best ores for each mine

If I ever finish that list, then maybe I'll make a guide of the best way to progress through each mine.
